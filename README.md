## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got some pratice with CSS fundamentals, I think I'm getting better at structuring my CSS and HTML and making more use of the cascade.

### Continued development

Spacing and Layout are still things I need more practice with. I think grid might have been a better choice for the main layout in this one, but I used flexbox because it was more familiar. I need to learn grid.
